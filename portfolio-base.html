    <ul>
        <li>The majority of people paid through card rather than using coins</li>
        <li>Some people would appear to read the parking meter and then continue on with their journey without paying</li>
        <li>Many people took more than 2 minutes timed to finish using the parking meter and continue</li>
        <li>Most people had no real use for the X button on the interface</li>
        <li>Many people took a moment to identify the parking meter after getting out of their car</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
        <li>What is your first thought when you see this parking meter?</li>
        <li>Is there anything unique about this parking meter? </li>
        <li>Is there any reason that you would prefer a different parking meter over this one?</li>
        <li>Do you have any opinions pertaining to the two screens that the parking meter has?</li>
        <li>If you had never used a parking meter before, would this one provide an adequate explanation on how to do so?</li>
